Changes since release 1.0
=========================

Release 1.3 - Jun 4, 2013
-------------------------
* This version can process iRefIndex releases 10 and 11.
* The mappings.txt file from iRefIndex is no longer optional. This does mean
  that the processing time will significantly increase but it also guarantees
  that all possible identifiers will be processed.
* A new algorithm for assigning Gene IDs is used.

Release 1.2 - Jul 24, 2012
--------------------------
* Updated Phase 1 so that all unspecified or obsolete for detection method,
  interaction type and experimental role are now set to proper PSI-MI terms
  (these are sometimes guessed).
* Added an option for the main ppiTrim script to set the minimum complex size.
  The default is 4.
* Updated the download URL for psi-mi.obo.
* Changed handling complexes in Phase 2 and Phase 3. In Phase 2, all binary
  interactions that specify bait/prey experimental roles are spoke-deflated
  (depending on minimum and maximum complex size). These interactions are now
  never deflated using template matching. On the other hand, interactions
  without bait/prey specified are only template matched. Furthermore, at Phase
  3, we allow conflicts between complexes. Two complexes are in conflict if
  they could be based on the same experiment but must be different records due
  to incompatibilities. These could be differences in detection method term, or
  if the bait is the same, because sets of preys are different.

Release 1.1 - Mar 26, 2012
--------------------------
* Updated the parser so that it can handle complexes from iRefIndex 9.0.
* Added a script to dump ppiTrim results into an sqlite database
  (experimental).
* Small bug fixes.

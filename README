ppiTrim - README
================

Summary
-------

ppiTrim is a Python script for constructing a consolidated reference database
of protein-protein interactions. It processes iRefIndex dataset in PSI-MI TAB
2.6 format (54 columns) and outputs a consolidated dataset. The output format
is also PSI-MI TAB 2.6, but with only 36 standard columns. Processing consists
of three steps:

1. mapping all interactants to NCBI Gene IDs and removing all undesired
   interactions,
2. contracting expanded complexes, and
3. consolidating all redundant interactions and detecting conflicts between
   annotations by different source databases.

The output interactions are classified as either undirected, directed or
complexes, where complexes denote more than two proteins interacting at the
same time.


Requirements
------------

ppiTrim has been developed using Python 2.6 on Linux machines. It only relies
on the Python standard library and hence should be usable on other
platforms. We have tested it on MacOSX and Windows, as well as under Python 2.5.


Download and Installation
-------------------------

The source code for the ppiTrim is available from the NCBI FTP site
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/qmbpmn/ppiTrim/src) as a tar.gz archive. Subsequent
releases will be placed in the same directory.

After downloading the source code, extract it to a chosen directory and enter the
``ppiTrim-<version>`` directory. To install all necessary files run::

    python setup.py install

The installation script will install the Python module ppiTrim and the script
ppiTrim to appropriate locations on your system. Please consult the `Installing
Python Modules <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html/>`_  guide from the
Python documentation.


Running ppiTrim
---------------

ppiTrim is a command-line script. Assuming the installation process places the
script somewhere on your path, run::

    ppiTrim [OPTIONS] <irefindex_file> <download_dir> <output_dir>

Please run::

    ppiTrim -h

to obtain help on possible options and arguments. The files downloaded from the
Internet will be placed in ``<download_dir>`` while the intermediate output
files as well as the final consolidated dataset will be placed in
``<output_dir>``. The final dataset filename will be::

    <irefindex_file>.ppiTrim.txt

All intermediate files will also have ``<irefindex_file>`` as prefix. The
statistics for each phase are located at the end of that phases' log file. For
example, the statistics for phase 2 are at the bottom of the file::

    <irefindex_file>.phase2.log


Potential Issues
----------------

ppiTrim downloads all its required supplementary data from the Internet. Hence
a failed download or failure of upstream services at the NCBI or EBI site
will result in a crash. The solution for this is to delete the files from the
downloads directory and restart ppiTrim. Generally, ppiTrim will not repeat the
steps it finished. Note that many times it is sufficient to just delete the
last few downloaded files rather than all of them.
